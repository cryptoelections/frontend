# Cryptoelections

blockchain-based game where gamers can pay to get the influence in the city and become a mayor. Different cities has different number of voters and all this electorate will vote for their mayor on presidential election. Unlike real life in CryptoElections one person can be a mayor in many cities and use this power to win a presidential campaign. Mayor is the most powerful person in the city. He can change the coat of arms (coming soon) and even write a new slogan (coming soon). If someone rich comes to displace him he can not stop him, but he can use his power to earn money on it. Up to 2x when someone displace you as a mayor. Win a presidential election is a big deal. You need to get the influence over 50% + 1 voters. The best thing about being a president is his ability to collect taxes. If someone decide to run a mayoral campaign in his country 1% of all money spent on campaign comes to a president.
